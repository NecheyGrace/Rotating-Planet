//You are given an array of integers numbers and two integers left and right. You task is to calculate a boolean array result, where result[i] = true if there exists an integer x, such that numbers[i] = (i + 1) * x and left ≤ x ≤ right. Otherwise, result[i] should be set to false.
function solution(numbers, left, right) {
